Expiriment Options: 
	Get a webcam and stick it on the department eye trackers to see how similar the results are. 
	Get a tobii infared tracker and use that to compare the accuracy 
	Left or right would be pretty good, but more accuracy is better. 
	If we use glasses we could have the computer beep to sync the times. 
	30 hrz seems fast enough
	Generally we're working within 100 ms
	Find out if the tracker still works when the web browser is closed
	Look at timing, issues with different clocks that aren't perfectly synced -> this is why we want to do simultaneous eye tracking
